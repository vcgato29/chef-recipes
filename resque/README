Installation steps
------------------

1. Copy resque directory to your app's cookbooks/ folder. If you do not have a cookbooks folder, you'll need
   to create one and copy over the "main" directory from engineyard/ey-cloud-recipes.
2. Customize the template on line 5 and 6 to meet your needs. Alternately, if you want all workers to run
   all queues, you may switch the recipe to use the resque_all_queues.pill.erb template instead.
3. Customize the template's mem_usage setting to be appropriate for your application.
4. Customize the recipe's num_workers to meet your needs.
5. If you are using bundler, set :bundler => true in the recipe to avoid issues invoking rake.
6. Add the after restart hook from after_restart.rb to your deploy/after_restart.rb file (create one if you
   don't have one). You can then delete this file from your local cookbook.
7. Add "require_recipe 'resque'" to your main/recipes/default.rb.
8. Commit and push your changes.
9. Upload your recipe to your app by running "ey recipes upload -e environment_name"
10. Run "ey recipes apply" to apply your custom recipes and then "ey deploy" to deploy. Alternately, you can do
    a full deploy from the EY Cloud dashboard.


Troubleshooting
---------------

There are no known issues at this time, presuming you follow all the steps above. Just make sure to set your
queues, mem_usage, num_workers, and bundler settings appropriately!
